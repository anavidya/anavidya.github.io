Document databases are built around semi-structeured data like XML or JSON like type of documents. This is becoming the popular alternative to 
relational databases and sometimes called as NoSQL Database.
These databases allow fundamental operations like create, read, update and delete(CRUD) on documents and their contents.
The querying language is similar to SQL. Adhoc queries, real time aggregations, indexing are some of the transformations possible with the quering language.
These database can perform better on 'Big data' since the database is distributed at their core. 
Documents are stored across multiple servers as they are not dependent.

    <h1>When to use document Database</h1>
 </header>

<h4>When data is semistructured</h4>
<p>When the data has many columns or attributes which are not filled in yet, or have complicated relationships or 
	have complex nested structures, 
it is preferable to use document database as an alternative.</p>
<h4>When you do have the capacity to model the whole domain at the moment</h4>
<h4> Some of the popular document Databases are mangoDB, amazon Dynamo DB, cassandra and so on.</h4>
