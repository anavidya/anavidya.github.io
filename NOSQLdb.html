Document databases are built around semi-structeured data like XML or JSON like type of documents. This is becoming the popular alternative to 
relational databases and sometimes called as NoSQL Database.
These databases allow fundamental operations like create, read, update and delete(CRUD) on documents and their contents.
The querying language is similar to SQL. Adhoc queries, real time aggregations, indexing are some of the transformations possible with the quering language.
These database can perform better on 'Big data' since the database is distributed at their core. 
Documents are stored across multiple servers as they are not dependent.
